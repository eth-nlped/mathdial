I started by figuring out that one dozen is equal to 12, so two dozens is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 pens. Then, I figured out that half of a dozen is equal to 6, so half of 12 is equal to 6 and half of a dozen is equal to 6. After that, I calculated that one and a half dozen is equal to 1 x 12 + 6 = 18 pens. Finally, I added 24 + 18 to get the total of two and a half dozens of pens, which is equal to 42 pens.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)steven in the first two sentences of your solution, you have correctly calculated that 2 dozens is 24 and half dozen is 6. so one and a half dozen would simply mean adding these two. |EOM|Student: Oh, that makes sense. So one and a half dozen is equal to 24 + 6 = 30 pens. Then, two and a half dozen is equal to 24 + 18 = 42 pens.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)two and a half dozen is equal to 30. |EOM|Student: No, two and a half dozen is equal to 24 + 18 = 42 pens.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)add one dozen + one dozen + half dozen and tell me how much do you get/|EOM|Student: One dozen is equal to 12, so two dozens is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 pens. Half of a dozen is equal to 6, so one and a half dozen is equal to 1 x 12 + 6 = 18 pens. Therefore, two and a half dozen is equal to 24 + 18 = 42 pens.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)the calculation should be either 24+6=30 or (12x2)+(12x 0.5)= 24+6=30. |EOM|Student: Yes, you're right. One and a half dozen is equal to 24 + 6 = 30 pens. Then, two and a half dozen is equal to 24 + 18 = 42 pens."}

I started by figuring out how many people each serving would feed. I knew that the 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides feed 6 people, so I divided 6 by 8 to get 0.75 people per serving. Then, I figured out how many servings I would need to feed 36 people. I divided 36 by 0.75 to get 48 servings. Finally, I figured out how many sets of the chicken bucket and sides I would need to buy in order to feed everyone. I divided 48 by 6 to get 8 sets. Then, I multiplied 8 by $12 to get the total cost of $96.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)I think you're overcomplicating the problem. Think about the $12 meal as one unit. How many people does it feed?|EOM|Student: Oh, right. The $12 meal feeds 6 people. So, if I want to feed 36 people, I would need to buy 36/6 = 6 units. The total cost would be 6 x $12 = $72.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)What was your error?|EOM|Student: My error was that I didn't think of the $12 meal as one unit. I was trying to calculate the cost of individual servings instead of the cost of the meal as a whole."}
